## Features

The Roll-a-Ball game has been enhanced with the following functionalities:

1. **Jump Height Restriction** - The playerâ€™s jump is capped to stay within the game plane, preventing unintended exits. Additionally, the player can only perform a jump when in contact with the ground. This mechanic ensures that the player cannot jump indefinitely and exit the game plane.
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts for Scene Navigation** - Quick and convenient keyboard shortcuts allow smooth transitions between game scenes.
3. **Key-Specific Player Actions** - Keybindings for actions enhance accessibility and compatibility across different devices.

| Keyboard Shortcut | Action         |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| `Space`           | Jump           |
| `Escape`          | Pause the game |

4. **Collision Sound Effects** - Added immersive sound effects trigger on each collision event, enhancing game feedback.
5. **Button Controls** - Button-based actions streamline gameplay, improving flow and responsiveness.

| Button       | Action                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `Resume`     | Resume the game                                  |
| `Restart`    | Restart the game                                 |
